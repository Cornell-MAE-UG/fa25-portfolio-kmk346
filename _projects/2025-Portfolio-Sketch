As part of a homework assignment, I was tasked with sketching a mechanism responsible for lighting the maximum possible weight 
to the highest possible height. This had to be achieved under certain constraints, such as including a total of 3 pin supports,
two of which had to be mounted on the ground and utilizing a linear actuator taken from an online catalog. Moreover, it was assume that all the supports and bar/actuator are rigid and that the actuator would exert its maximum force. <br> <br>

The image below demonstrates how I went about the problem and created a mechanism that met the requirements. 
The actuator would be responsible for retracting a rope that would lift the weight, while the bars and pin supports would ensure
the stability of the entire structure.<br> <br>

For the second half of this project, I was asked to follow a new set of tasks. Below you will find the outline. <br> <br>

Step 1: <br>

a) Create sections to define the problem, your constraints/objectives, and your
design degrees of freedom.<br>
b) Treating the bar as rigid, revisit your previous work by describing the
static analysis you conducted to determine your final design. <br>
c) Present your final mechanism design in an image or drawing. <br> <br>
Step 2: The bar in your mechanism is no longer rigid. In fact, it is now best described as
a beam which bends due to the combined action of the weight and the actuator force. 
Consider only the components of these forces transverse to your beam: <br>
a) Find the maximum deflection in your beam. State your assumptions clearly and
describe your analysis.<br>
b) Choose a beam design (cross-section, material) such that its vertical deflection is
below 2% of its length and is the most mass-efficient possible.<br>
c) Present your final beam design in an image or drawing.<br> <br>

The images demonstrate the new approach and implentation of our new findings in ENGRD2020.
