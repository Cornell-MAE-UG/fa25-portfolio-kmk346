As part of a homework assignment, I was tasked with sketching a mechanism responsible for lighting the maximum possible weight 
to the highest possible height. This had to be achieved under certain constraints, such as including a total of 3 pin supports,
two of which had to be mounted on the ground and utilizing a linear actuator taken from an online catalog. Moreover, it was assumed
that all the supports and bar/actuator are rigid and that the actuator would exert its maximum force. 

The image below demonstrates how I went about the problem and created a mechanism that met the requirements. 
The actuator would be responsible for retracting a rope that would lift the weight, while the bars and pin supports would ensure
the stability of the entire structure.

For the second half of this project, I was asked to follow a new set of tasks. Below you will find the outline.
