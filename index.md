## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profile-pic.png" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is Kacper Kowalski, and I am a second year student at Cornell University stuyding Civil Engineering. Having grown up playing with Thomas the Tank Engine toys and building train tracks all over my living room floor, I have developed a strong passion for understanding structures. This interest only continued to unfold as I started to explore more of the place that I call home, New York City. Whether it was a trip to Manhattan to get my physical done or a car ride over the Throgs Neck Bridge to start a vacation, there was always something of interest that caught my eye.

In my free time I strongly enjoy hanging out with my friends and family as they play an signifanct role in forming who I am as a person today. Ever since my arrival to Ithaca, I have found myself spending much more time outside, exploring trials and viewing the beautiful nature that surrounds the city. On campus, you can find me playing volleyball and soccer, engaging with others and always looking to try to new things!
